# Hashing-Alorithm

The assignment is to test the quality of some of the famous hashing algorithms in terms of Collision counts

Build a diagram from the result of the following experiment

Choose 5 hashing algorithms
 
Generate a number of SSNs and try to hash them using the function (no restriction on SSNs except they have to have 10 digits)
 
Count the collisions that occur

Generate a table and a diagram like we did with assignment 1  For the number of collisions for each hash function used as you increase the number of SSNs  until you reach the hash table size of 10000 ( we will use that table size for now)

Build your class using separate chaining method to only count the initial  hashing collisions
